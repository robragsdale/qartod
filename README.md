qartod
======
This started with GLOS' to document the DMAC aspects of certification and acknowledging that integration of QARTOD processes and standards across the IOOS RA enterprise could be done more efficiently and reduce overall resources to the IOOS RAs. This grew into and opportunity to collaborate on implementation.

Tad Slawecki (GLOS) posed two questions to gather more information before a Webinar on 17 September 2014 at 3 p.m. ET to discuss the issue.

How would QARTOD best fit into your RA's workflow?

GLOS: TBD. Our buoy data is currently ingested into a separate "OBS" database, and then passed on to 52N. We are in the process of instituting NODC submittals built from the OBS database contents, so nicest for us would be to apply QARTOD before OBS; if we transition to 52N-based NODC submittals, we might drop the OBS database and apply QARTOD before 52N.

NOW: PI -> OBS -> 52N
ALT1: PI -> QARTOD -> OBS -> 52N
ALT2: PI -> QARTOD -> 52N 
2. What type of collaboration would you like to see?

GLOS: Very open to different ideas, main thing is not to duplicate efforts across RAs. at a minimum, a shared resource that shows which RA is working on/has implemented a particular test? If we identify a common architecture for QARTOD application, perhaps implementation of different tests for different parameters can be undertaken by different RAs?
