#####IOOS DMAC QARTOD Working Group#####
A working group that will be keeping the pulse of QARTOD implementation efforts for the purpose of coordinated implementation. This working group will provide a forum for feedback/communication between the regional associations and program office implementation developers. Representatives from this working group will report up to the QARTOD BOA quarterly with status updates which provides the working group the opportunity to make requests for clarification from the BOA and to raise BOA awareness of implementation challenges.
